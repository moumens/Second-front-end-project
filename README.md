## About This Project

This is a simple single‑page website I built while learning the basics of HTML and CSS.

The project is **not responsive**, and I know the **color choices and background images are not perfect**. That was intentional — the main goal of this project was to practice core HTML and CSS concepts, not to create a fully polished design.

I’m learning front‑end fundamentals to support my long‑term goal of becoming a **bug bounty hunter**. Since my focus is cybersecurity, I didn’t prioritize design quality or responsiveness for this project.

Thanks for checking it out!
